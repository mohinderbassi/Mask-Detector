# mask-detection-COVID-19

### Prerequisites:
1.) Python environment is required for the code to run (eg. pycharm).

2.) Install following libraries using command prompt – opencv, numpy, opencv-contrib-python (these libraries are not found in python module thus need to be installed externally).

3.) Basic py3 knowledge is necessary.

4.) You much know the use and functions on opencv library.

5.) Make sure light of room is always on for better results!!!




### Steps to make face mask detection project:
1.) Firstly, you have to create a folder consisting your images as we need a stored data.

2.) Use data_generate.py file for generate your own data for mask and without mask images.

3.) After collecting the data of your photos in a folder, now you have to train your model and it’s ready for face detection.

4.) Refer to train_model.py code, I have explained the whole code in comments over there & HURRAY!! Our project Is ready.

5.) Once you understand face recognition, mask detection is quiet simple project.

6.) It basically runs this way - when it detects face it means mask is not found, whereas mask on face gets detected. This is highly useful at gate entry allowance but need a better camera and abetter model to best accuracy. However, this model only provides minimal accuracy.
